How to build the APIMan Guide Book in Docbook format
====================================================


This module is the source of the APIMan Guide document. We convert the asciidoc into an intermediate 
Docbook format, which then is used to create HTML and PDF versions. If you want to build these yourself, 
simply run the following:
----
mvn clean install
----
This will build HTML and PDF versions in the target/docbook/publish/en-US directory.
